### Problem Statement
In the competitive garment manufacturing industry, factories face significant challenges in optimizing workforce efficiency, managing production schedules, and maintaining quality standards. Factories typically struggle with:

- Uneven productivity across teams and departments
- Inefficient resource allocation and workforce planning
- Production bottlenecks and interruptions impacting delivery schedules
- Balancing production costs (overtime, incentives) with output targets
- Understanding the impact of production variables (style changes, seasonal patterns) on overall efficiency

This dashboard provides a comprehensive solution by visualizing productivity metrics, workforce distribution, and production efficiency data to enable data-driven decision-making and performance improvement.
